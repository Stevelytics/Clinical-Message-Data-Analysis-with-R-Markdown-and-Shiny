# Clinical-Message-Data-Analysis-with-R-Markdown-and-Shiny
This project processes and visualizes clinical message data using R scripts, specifically focusing on physician involvement in patient communication. The analysis is presented through a Shiny web application with interactive visualizations, and the analysis is documented using R Markdown for reproducibility.
